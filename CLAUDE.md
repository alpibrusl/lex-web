This repository is a **Lex** project. Lex is not Python with weird
syntax; it is a typed-effect language with a content-addressed AST and
an attestation graph. Treat the rules in this file as part of the task
brief.

## Mandatory reading before writing code

Run these in order:

```sh
lex --version                  # confirm Lex is installed; if missing, see below
lex agent-guidelines           # authoritative idiom rules — read in full
lex skill                      # CLI surface + exit codes (ACLI)
```

`lex agent-guidelines` is the prescriptive contract for this project.
Do not write code until you have read it. The rules are numbered and
stable; this CLAUDE.md exists only to point you at them and add
project-specific overrides.

## The discipline summary

The full rules live in `lex agent-guidelines`. The four that matter
most when you're tempted to skip them:

1. **Narrow effects, always.** `fn foo() -> [fs_write("/tmp/x")] T`,
   not `[fs_write]`, not `[fs_write, fs_read, io]`. If the type checker
   rejects, narrow the **body**, not the signature.
2. **Repair, don't regenerate.** When `lex check` fails, run
   `lex --output json check` to get the structured error, then
   `lex repair --apply --transform '<suggested_transform>'`. Only
   regenerate after two failed repair attempts.
3. **`examples {}` blocks on every pure fn.** They're part of the
   SigId and run at `lex check` time — free regression tests with no
   `tests/` boilerplate.
4. **Use the stdlib.** `std.crypto` not hand-rolled crypto, `std.conc`
   not threads, `std.sql` not string-concat SQL, `std.regex` not
   manual scanners. Reach for raw bytes only after checking the
   stdlib index.

## The loop

Every change goes through the same four steps. **Do not claim a task
done before all four are green.**

```sh
lex check --strict src/        # type-check with extra lints
lex fmt --check src/ tests/    # formatting (must be canonical)
lex test                        # all tests/test_*.lex files
lex ci                          # umbrella: same as the above + pkg install
```

If `lex check` fails, do **not** broaden the effect signature to
make it pass. Investigate the body. See `lex agent-guidelines` § 1.2.

## When in doubt

```sh
lex agent-guidelines        # the rules
lex skill                   # the CLI surface
lex --output json check <file>   # structured errors with rule_tag + suggested_transform
lex blame <fn> --with-evidence   # what attestations already cover this fn
```

Lex toolchain version pinned by this project: see `lex.toml` /
`.github/workflows/lex.yml`. If `lex --version` reports a different
version locally, install the pinned one from
<https://github.com/alpibrusl/lex-lang/releases> before continuing.

## Project-specific overrides — lex-web

- **`net` effect is mandatory on HTTP/WS entry points** (`web.serve`,
  `ws.serve`, `ws.dial`). Per-host scope via `--allow-net-host` at the
  policy gate; AGENTS rule §1.4.
- **Router middleware composes left-to-right via `|>`.** Handlers
  return `resp.Response`; never construct raw HTTP bytes.
- **`ws.dial` (lex-lang 0.9.3) is the only supported outbound WS
  path.** Don't drop into `net.dial_ws` directly from downstream code
  — go through `ws.dial` so the `WsAction` reply shape and
  effect-row propagation stay consistent.
- **WS handler shape:** `fn (WsConn, WsMessage) -> [E] WsAction`. Use
  `ws.send` / `ws.send_binary` / `ws.noop` instead of constructing
  `WsSend(...)` literals at handler sites.
- **Examples under `examples/` are smoke-tested in CI.** Adding a new
  example means wiring it into the workflow's smoke matrix.
